# AI Legal Multi-Agent Automation Workflow

## Project Description

**AI Legal Multi-Agent Automation Workflow** is an advanced, modular legal automation framework leveraging multiple specialized AI agents to streamline the legal document drafting and analysis process. By orchestrating a pipeline of agents—responsible for intake, fault analysis, and document generation—this system empowers legal professionals to automate routine legal workflows, accelerate case assessments, and generate professional legal documents with AI assistance.

## Features

- **Multi-Agent Architecture:** Agents for intake, fault analysis, and document creation work together in a seamless pipeline.
- **Streamlit UI:** User-friendly web interface for entering case details and reviewing AI-generated outputs.
- **Robust Error Handling:** Tolerant to varying outputs from agents (dict, stringified JSON, etc.), always extracting the correct legal letter.
- **Legal Document Automation:** Generates draft legal letters ready for attorney review.
- **Extensible:** Easily add new agents for further automation (e.g., settlement estimators, case management, etc.).
- **Disclaimer Built-In:** All drafts are clearly marked as AI-generated and require review.

## Workflow Overview

1. **User Intake:**  
   The user enters case information (client name, date of incident, location, description, witnesses, etc.) via the web interface.

2. **Intake Agent:**  
   Structures and validates the provided data.

3. **Fault Analysis Agent:**  
   Analyzes the scenario, identifies missing facts, and produces a legal "chain of thought."

4. **Document Generation Agent:**  
   Generates a draft legal letter or document based on the analysis.

5. **Review & Export:**  
   The user reviews the generated analysis and letter, marking it as "ready for attorney review."
